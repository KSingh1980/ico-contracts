<p class=MsoTitle>NEUMARK TOKEN HOLDER AGREEMENT </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Agreement version: 1, last updated: {signed-by-company-date}</p>

<p class=MsoTitle>Preamble</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Neumark Token Holder Agreement (the „<b>Agreement</b>”)
is concluded between Fifth Force GmbH, a limited liability company organised
under the laws of Germany, having its seat in Berlin, Germany, registered with
the commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht)
Charlottenburg under HRB 179357 B, with business address at: Cuvrystraße 4,
10997 Berlin, Germany (the „<b>Company</b>”), or any legal successor of
Company, and any entity that fulfils the criteria set out in this Agreement and
accepts the terms provided herein (the „<b>Token Holder</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parties to the Agreement are herein referred to individually
as a „<b>Party</b>” and collectively as the „<b>Parties</b>”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Company is identified by the following address
{company-address} on Ethereum network. Ethereum network is a public distributed
ledger that allows to deploy self-enforcing contracts called smart contracts
and provides global consensus of contract enforcement outcomes. The Token
Holder is identified by the following address {token-holder-address} on
Ethereum network (“<b>Ethereum Address</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Company develops and operates the Neufund Platform,
which is a fundraising ecosystem (the “<b>Fundraising Platform</b>”).
Fundraising Platform aims to enable start-ups to use the legal and technical
infrastructure for raising equity or quasi-equity investments to finance
entities or individual projects. Such fundraising will be structured through
the issuing of tokens – including equity tokens – based on blockchain
technology (the “<b>Start-up Tokens</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Agreement sets forth principles, terms and conditions
of use by the Token Holder of related Ethereum Tokens issued by the Company, as
set out in a smart contract under address {neumark-sc-address} (the “<b>Neumark
Token Smart Contract</b>”). The Neumark Token Smart Contract source code is
available in repository {repo-url} with commit {commit-id} (the “<b>Repository</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Content of the Agreement and of all its amendments is stored
in public immutable storage where it can be retrieved by cryptographic hash of
a file with the Agreement content. Company will sign Agreement and any of its
amendment by executing a transaction on the Neumark Token Smart Contract that
will add Agreement hash to contract state thus providing proof of Company
signature and of Agreement content. Token Holder may access current Agreement
and all amendments by inspecting Neumark Token Smart Contract state which is
publicly available on Ethereum network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The terms outlined in the Agreement correspond to the
self-enforcing computer code of the Neumark Token Smart Contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This document does not constitute a prospectus or offering
or securities of any sort and is not a solicitation for investment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Agreement may be amended in accordance with section XXX
below.</p>
