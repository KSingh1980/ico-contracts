<p class=MsoTitle>RESERVATION AGREEMENT </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Agreement version: 1, last updated:
{signed-by-company-date}</i></p>

<p class=MsoTitle>Preamble</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Reservation Agreement (the “<b>Agreement</b>”) is
concluded between Fifth Force GmbH, a limited liability company organised under
the laws of Germany, having its seat in Berlin, Germany, registered with the
commercial register (Handelsregister) of the local court (Amtsgericht)
Charlottenburg under HRB 179357 B, with business address at: Cuvrystraße 4,
10997 Berlin, Germany (the “<b>Company</b>”), or any legal successor of
Company, and any entity that fulfils the criteria set out in this Agreement and
accepts the terms provided herein (the “<b>Investor</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parties to the Agreement are herein referred to individually
as a “<b>Party</b>” and collectively as the “<b>Parties</b>”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Company is identified by the following address
{company-address} on Ethereum network. Ethereum network is a public distributed
ledger that allows to deploy self-enforcing contracts called smart contracts
and provides global consensus of contract enforcement outcomes. The Investor is
identified by the following address {investor-address} on Ethereum network (“<b>Ethereum
Address</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Company develops and operates the Neufund Platform,
which is a fundraising ecosystem (the “<b>Fundraising Platform</b>”).
Fundraising Platform aims to enable start-ups to use the legal and technical
infrastructure for raising equity or quasi-equity investments to finance
entities or individual projects. Such fundraising will be structured through
the issuing of tokens – including equity tokens – based on blockchain
technology (the “<b>Start-up Tokens</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The subject of the Agreement is the reservation of funds by
the Investor for the future acquisition of Start-up Tokens on the Fundraising
Platform (the “<b>Reservation</b>”) as well as acquisition of related Ethereum
tokens issued by the Company (the “<b>Neumark Tokens</b>”) by the Investor from
the Company (the “<b>Acquisition</b>”). The Reservation and the Acquisition
shall take place under the terms and conditions as set out in:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>a smart contract under address {acquisition-sc-address} (the “<b>Acquisition
Smart Contract</b>”) and</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>a smart contract under address {lockin-sc-address} (the “<b>Reservation
Smart Contract</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Acquisition Smart Contract and Reservation Smart
Contract are jointly referred to in this Agreement as “<b>Smart Contracts</b>”.
The Smart Contracts source code is available in repository {repo-url} with
commit {commit-id} (the “<b>Repository</b>”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Content of the Agreement and of all its amendments is stored
in public immutable storage where it can be retrieved by cryptographic hash of
a file with Agreement content. Company will sign Agreement and any of its
amendment by executing a transaction on Acquisition Smart Contract that will
add Agreement hash to contract state thus providing proof of Company signature
and of Agreement content. Investor may access current Agreement and all
amendments by inspecting Acquisition Smart Contract state which is publicly
available on Ethereum network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The terms outlined in the Agreement correspond to the
self-enforcing computer code of the Smart Contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By concluding this Agreement, the Investor enters into the
Neumark Token Holder Agreement (the “<b>NTHA</b>”), on the terms and conditions
as set out in a smart contract under address {neumark-sc-address} (“<b>Neumark
Token Smart Contract</b>”). Acceptance of the terms and conditions and
conclusion of the NTHA is required in order to conclude this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This document does not constitute a prospectus or offering
or securities of any sort and is not a solicitation for investment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Agreement may be amended in accordance with section 5 below.</p>
